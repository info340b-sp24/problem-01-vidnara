        Aang is a character from the popular television series 
        <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender">Avatar The Last Airbender,</a>
        which aired on Nickelodeon from 2005 to 2008. This show took place in a world where people had the ability to manipulate either
        water, earth, fire, or air, with one person being able to manipulate all four of the elements: the Avatar. In this show, Aang is the Avatar,
        and is also the last living member of the "Airbender" race, as he was in a 100 year coma in which the air nation was killed off through genocide.
        With the friends he makes on his journey, it is his job to learn how to manipulate all four elements and 
        stop the tyrannical fire nation that has been colonizing every corner of the world
